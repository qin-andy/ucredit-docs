# Dashboard
Here's where we'd put components related to the dashboard.

There are different kinds of components here. Course list, which is the whole 4 year view, and the Right Column,
which shows the credit distributions.

## Course List Components

## Right Column Components

### Example Components
Note the ### instead of ##. Here, we would put description for a specific component.

### Another Component
Hopefully the documentation for each component isn't super long. Read the code for implementation details,
the documentation should be a compilation of existing comments, but also putting things in a human readable context.
