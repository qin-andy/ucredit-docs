## Look at all these Subheadings!

Here's a second test header. Hello team!

### Some code in a subheading

```jsx title="path/to/some/file.tsx"
// Here's my code
const SomeComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>This is an example component. Pretty neat.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Here's a second one.

The right sidebar should be automatically picking these up. Pretty neat huh?

### Test out the search.

Try searching for the term "Inazuma". It should lead to this page!
